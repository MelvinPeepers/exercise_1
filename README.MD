# Exercise:

Create a simple site (hosted on Netlify and repo on Github). Criteria:

- Ask user their name, age, location but ask it individually, hiding / showing the next question

- Write a sentence with those 3 inputs

- Write all of this into the “main” branch of your repo. no need for a separate branch or pull request for now
