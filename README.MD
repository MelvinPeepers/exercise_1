# Exercise:

Create a simple site (hosted on Netlify and repo on Github). Criteria:

- Ask user their name, age, location but ask it individually, hiding / showing the next question

- Write a sentence with those 3 inputs

- Write all of this into the “main” branch of your repo. no need for a separate branch or pull request for now

## Next Round:

- Create a separate branch to work on this task, deploy it on netlify
- Keep everything that you have and query https://swapi.py4e.com/documentation (using netlify function):
  - Get a list of 5 planets (https://swapi.py4e.com/documentation#planets) of your choosing (bonus points if its always 5 different ones)
  - Ask the user what is their favorite planet
  - Print that planet name is a sentence
